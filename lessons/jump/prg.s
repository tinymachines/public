;; A square that walks and jumps the way Mario does, with the numbers
;; read off Mario's own runs (the storyboard): 1.5 pixels a frame at
;; full walking speed, a jump that starts at 4 pixels a frame upward,
;; a light pull of 30/256 while A is held on the way up, a pull of
;; 96/256 otherwise, and no falling faster than 4 pixels a frame.
;; Positions and speeds are two bytes: a whole pixel and 256ths of one.
;; Each frame in the air moves by the speed first and pulls after: in
;; the other order every jump comes out three or four pixels lower than
;; Mario's.
;;
;; Memory: $00 the frame flag the NMI sets, $01 the pad, $02 the pad a
;; frame ago, $03 1 while in the air, $10/$11 x (fraction, pixel),
;; $12/$13 the speed across, $14/$15 y, $16/$17 the speed down.
