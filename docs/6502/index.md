# The simulator

A transistor-level simulation of the MOS 6502, in Rust and WebAssembly, with a
WebGL renderer of the actual die. It is a ground-up rebuild of
[visual6502](http://visual6502.org), whose die trace and simulation approach it
is built on.

Nothing here models 6502 *behaviour*. There is no instruction decoder, no
addressing-mode table, no cycle-count lookup. There are 1725 wires and 3510
switches, and the behaviour falls out of simulating them. Every register value
you see is read back out of storage nodes on the die; every cycle count is
emergent.

## What it does

- **Runs the real chip.** Switch-level simulation of the revD die, verified
  bit-exact against the original implementation.
- **Shows the die.** 83,227 triangles of real polygon geometry, with live logic
  state, at any zoom.
- **Traces signals.** Click any wire to see what it is connected to *at that
  instant*: the connected group changes as transistors switch.
- **Steps backwards.** Keyframed rewind over the last 4096 half-cycles.
- **Exposes the microarchitecture.** Internal T-states, clock phase, the bus
  handshake, and the ALU's hold register, including things behavioural
  emulators paper over.

## The result that is in no register

The 6502 does not put an ALU result into the accumulator when the instruction
ends. `ADC` reaches the *next* opcode fetch with the accumulator still holding
the old value; the result sits in the ALU hold register and transfers a cycle
later. `LDA`, which bypasses the ALU, lands a cycle earlier.

Step through `LDA #$50 / CLC / ADC #$50` one half-cycle at a time and watch
where `A` actually changes. An emulator that commits results at instruction
boundaries cannot show you this, because it is not true of the silicon.

## How it is put together

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `v6502-netlist` | Immutable topology: nodes, transistors, names. No state. |
| `v6502-sim` | Switch-level solver, 6502 clock and bus layer, rewind. |
| `v6502-wasm` | `wasm-bindgen` surface. |
| `web/` | WebGL2 renderer and UI. Plain ES modules, no framework, no build step. |

A node's logic level is not a property of the node but of the **group** of
nodes currently shorted together through conducting transistors. Settling means
rebuilding groups, resolving each to a level, propagating, and repeating to a
fixed point.

The renderer turns on one fact: the layout never changes. The triangles go to
the GPU once; each frame uploads only a 1725-byte array of node levels as a
texture the vertex shader samples by node ID. A frame is six draw calls,
regardless of zoom.

## Speed

About 28,500 half-cycles per second natively, roughly 94 times the original
JavaScript implementation. That figure is the native engine, not the served
API: [the API page](/docs/6502/the-api) carries the per-instance number, which
is lower and measured separately.

## Licensing, before redistributing

The code is **MIT**. The chip data it is built from is not. `segdefs.js` and
`transdefs.js` in the visual6502 submodule, which are the polygon and
transistor geometry, are **CC BY-NC-SA 3.0**, copyright 2010 Greg James, Brian
Silverman and Barry Silverman, with attribution required to Greg James and
www.visual6502.org.

That matters because the build *derives from* that data. The generated
`netlist.bin` and `layout.bin`, any `.wasm` embedding them, and any deployed
instance all inherit **NonCommercial** and **ShareAlike** terms. The repository
does not redistribute the data, which is why it is a submodule, but a build
does.

In short: fork it, learn from it, host it non-commercially with attribution. A
commercial use would need the geometry re-derived from an independent die
trace, or separate permission from the rights holders.

`halfphi` is the exception and is MIT with no such obligation, because it names
no chip and embeds no die data.

## Credit

This exists because the [visual6502](http://visual6502.org) team decapped a
6502, photographed the die, and traced every polygon by hand, then gave it
away. Greg James, Brian Silverman, Barry Silverman, Ed Spittles, Segher
